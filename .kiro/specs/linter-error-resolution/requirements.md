# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The zKkeynest application currently has numerous ESLint and TypeScript linter errors that are preventing production deployment. These errors include unused variables, missing dependencies in React hooks, unescaped entities in JSX, explicit `any` types, and Next.js optimization warnings. The goal is to systematically resolve all linter errors to enable clean production builds without suppressing these important code quality checks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unused variable and import warnings resolved, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable without dead code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the linter runs THEN there SHALL be no `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` warnings
2. WHEN imports are declared THEN they SHALL be used in the component or removed
3. WHEN variables are declared THEN they SHALL be used in their scope or removed
4. WHEN function parameters are declared THEN they SHALL be used or prefixed with underscore if intentionally unused

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all React Hook dependency warnings resolved, so that components behave predictably and avoid stale closure bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN useEffect hooks are used THEN all dependencies SHALL be included in the dependency array
2. WHEN callback functions are used in useEffect THEN they SHALL be wrapped in useCallback if they change frequently
3. WHEN dependency arrays are incomplete THEN they SHALL be updated to include all referenced variables
4. WHEN functions are used in effects THEN they SHALL be memoized appropriately to prevent infinite re-renders

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all explicit `any` types replaced with proper TypeScript types, so that the codebase maintains type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `any` types are used THEN they SHALL be replaced with specific TypeScript interfaces or types
2. WHEN event handlers receive events THEN they SHALL use proper React event types
3. WHEN API responses are handled THEN they SHALL have defined interfaces
4. WHEN third-party library types are unavailable THEN proper type assertions SHALL be used instead of `any`

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unescaped entities in JSX resolved, so that the HTML renders correctly and follows React best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN apostrophes are used in JSX text THEN they SHALL be escaped with `&apos;` or use proper quotes
2. WHEN quotation marks are used in JSX text THEN they SHALL be escaped with `&quot;` or use proper quotes
3. WHEN special characters are used in JSX THEN they SHALL be properly escaped or use character codes
4. WHEN text content contains HTML entities THEN they SHALL be properly formatted for JSX

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Next.js optimization warnings resolved, so that the application follows performance best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL use Next.js `Image` component instead of `<img>` tags
2. WHEN static images are used THEN they SHALL be optimized for web delivery
3. WHEN images have alt text THEN they SHALL be descriptive and accessible
4. WHEN performance-critical images are used THEN they SHALL include proper loading and sizing attributes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all variable declaration warnings resolved, so that the code follows modern JavaScript best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN variables are never reassigned THEN they SHALL be declared with `const` instead of `let`
2. WHEN variable scope is determined THEN the most restrictive declaration SHALL be used
3. WHEN variables are initialized THEN they SHALL use appropriate declaration keywords
4. WHEN block-scoped variables are needed THEN `let` SHALL be used appropriately
