# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The navbar on the homepage currently only includes navigation links for "How it works" and "Pricing" sections, but the homepage contains several additional sections that users should be able to navigate to directly. This feature will enhance user experience by providing quick access to all homepage sections through the navigation bar.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the homepage, I want to see navigation links for all major sections in the navbar, so that I can quickly jump to any section that interests me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the homepage THEN the navbar SHALL display navigation links for all visible homepage sections
2. WHEN a user clicks on a navbar link THEN the page SHALL smoothly scroll to the corresponding section
3. WHEN a user hovers over a navbar link THEN the link SHALL show a visual hover state with the brand color

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor using a mobile device, I want to access navigation links through a mobile menu, so that I can navigate to different sections even on smaller screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the homepage on a mobile device THEN the navbar SHALL display a hamburger menu button
2. WHEN a user taps the hamburger menu THEN a mobile navigation menu SHALL open with all section links
3. WHEN a user taps a link in the mobile menu THEN the menu SHALL close and the page SHALL scroll to the selected section

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the navbar to remain accessible while scrolling, so that I can navigate to other sections at any time without scrolling back to the top.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls down the page THEN the navbar SHALL remain fixed at the top of the viewport
2. WHEN the navbar is fixed THEN it SHALL maintain its styling and functionality
