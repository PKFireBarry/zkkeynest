# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on identifying and removing unused code, functions, and duplicated logic throughout the zKkeynest codebase to reduce technical debt while maintaining existing functionality. The goal is to improve code maintainability, reduce bundle size, and eliminate dead code without changing the application's behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify unused functions and exports so that I can remove dead code from the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all exported functions, components, and variables that are not imported or used elsewhere
2. WHEN finding unused exports THEN the system SHALL verify they are not used in dynamic imports, string references, or external tooling
3. WHEN removing unused code THEN the system SHALL ensure no runtime errors are introduced

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to find duplicated code across multiple files so that I can consolidate it into reusable utilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for duplicated code THEN the system SHALL identify similar functions or logic blocks across different files
2. WHEN finding duplicated utility functions THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into appropriate shared locations
3. WHEN consolidating code THEN the system SHALL maintain the same functionality and behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify unused imports so that I can clean up import statements and reduce bundle size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing import statements THEN the system SHALL identify imports that are not used in their respective files
2. WHEN removing unused imports THEN the system SHALL ensure TypeScript compilation still succeeds
3. WHEN cleaning imports THEN the system SHALL maintain proper type imports vs value imports

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to find unused CSS classes and styles so that I can remove unnecessary styling code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing CSS and Tailwind classes THEN the system SHALL identify unused style definitions
2. WHEN removing unused styles THEN the system SHALL ensure visual appearance remains unchanged
3. WHEN cleaning CSS THEN the system SHALL preserve styles used in dynamic class generation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify unused environment variables and configuration so that I can clean up the configuration files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing environment variables THEN the system SHALL identify variables defined but not referenced in code
2. WHEN finding unused configuration THEN the system SHALL verify they are not used in build processes or external tools
3. WHEN removing configuration THEN the system SHALL ensure build and deployment processes remain functional

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to find unused type definitions and interfaces so that I can remove unnecessary TypeScript code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing TypeScript definitions THEN the system SHALL identify unused types, interfaces, and enums
2. WHEN removing unused types THEN the system SHALL ensure TypeScript compilation continues to work
3. WHEN cleaning type definitions THEN the system SHALL preserve types used in generic constraints or extends clauses

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify unused API routes and handlers so that I can remove unnecessary server-side code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing API routes THEN the system SHALL identify route handlers that are not called by the frontend
2. WHEN finding unused routes THEN the system SHALL verify they are not used by external services or webhooks
3. WHEN removing API routes THEN the system SHALL ensure no breaking changes to external integrations
